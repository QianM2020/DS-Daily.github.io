# Some features of Stack Overflow's developer and Trend of Programming Technology?
   A data-based approach using Stack Overflow’s developer survey data from 2017.


## Introduction
  Stack Overflow is an open community for anyone that codes. In its homepage, we can find the introduction like 
![在这里插入图片描述](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201219104812665.png)

> ’We build products that empower developers and connect them to solutions that enable productivity, growth, and discovery. ’  or  ‘We help you get answers to your toughest coding questions, share knowledge with your coworkers in private, and find your next dream job. ’
  
As a programming tiro, I never used  Stack Overflow before and quite interested in whehter it's a proper site for a novice like me to look for programming advices. In the other hand, are the resourses obtained and shared in Stack Overflow really practical and Professional ?

Also, coding is sometime tricky and difficult to find out the bug. I wonder what kind of Stack Overflow users can take advantage ot the open community efficiently. 

I used data from Stack Overflow’s 2017 Annual Developer Survey, to take a closer look at these question.In  the survey, it also provides data about the programming  technologies ( like programming language, framework, database and platform) which have been used by  most professional developers  in the past year​, and which they ​want​ to work in ​over the next year. It help me to get an idea about the dev tech trend.	
	
The survey data covers 64,000 reviews from 213 countries and territories. The survey aims to understand multiple aspects of respondents related to software development and data analytics. There were more than 150 questions as a part of the survey, including:

> “Do you program as a hobby or contribute to open source projects?”
“Which of the following best describes the highest level of formal education that you’ve completed?”
“How often do you work from home or remotely?”

## Part I. Is Stack Overflow professional?

The first question is how practically and professionally the open community works. Let’s take a closer look at 2 results from the survey 

> **‘Professional’** (**Q:** Which of the following best describes you?)

 and 
> **‘EmploymentStatus status’**( **Q:**Which of the following best describes your current employment status?)
> 
Here you can see in descending order the proportion of individual survey respondents ( can be regarded as Stack Overflow users) . The clear leaders are Professional developers and Full-time employees.
A little more than 70% of respondents suggest the open community is mostly used by professional developers, and 15% suggest students. These 2 groups composes about 90% of total respondents. Similarly, more than 70% of respondents are employed full-time, and over 90% are employees.

The data here are aggregated over all developers in the survey,  indicating that the contents shared in Stack Overflow are **practical and Professional**.

But it could be more interesting to know what kind of developers are more comfortable with this open community.

 

## Part II. What Kind of Developers Feel more Comfortable with Stack Overflow?

 
In the chart below, I was interested if the users with certain self-taught type would lead to use Stack Overflow with higher satisfaction. The red(represents  lower satisfaction) and green(represents higher satisfaction) bars represent a comparison of respondent’s satisfaction when they have different self-taught preference.

The chart shows that developers who are used to obtain program knowledges by using Stack Overflow, tend to give a high evaluation to  Stack Overflow. In other words, Stack Overflow are able to meet the most requirements from developers. From another perspective, we can get a clue that  the ‘Q&A’ and ‘Docs’ of Stack Overflow may play important roles.

## Part III. What’s the new tech trend?

Finally, I was curious about  what specific programming languages, Frameworks, and etc., the professional developers  are comfortable with and/or they tend to use in the near future.

In order to take a closer look at this, I divided the data into 4 subgroups. The groups were marked programing language, framework, database, and platfform. 

The tech which have been used in ​over the past year(shown in blue bars in below charts)​, and which they ​want​ to work in ​next year (shown in red bar) are compared.

Here we notice that The top 3 of commonly used programming Languages are stable : **Javascript, C** and **Pytho**n, if we exclude SQL from language.

Similiarly, the top 3 Frameworks are not changed a lot over year, they're **AngularJS, React, .NET Core**,

It's noticable that **MongoDB** turns to be hot these days, and SQL Server is exiled from the top 3 Databases.

For platforms, **Android** replace 'Windows Desktop' to rank among top 3, **AWS** turns to be the most popular.  

## Conclusion

In this article, we took a look at which type of developers Stack Overflow works for and the tech trend  according to Stack Overflow 2017 survey data.

 1. We measured the proposion of respondants' different professional level and different employed status,  which showed that most professional and full-time employed programmers were user of Stack Overflow.This showed that this open community was professional.
 2. We looked at the satisfaction associated with self-taught type. We found that those who are used to Stack Overflow, tend to give a high evaluation to it.
 3. We finally found that MongoDB and AWS turns to be popular among developers.
 
The findings here are observational, not the result of a formal study. So the real question remains:

> How will YOU use the Stack Overflow effectively?
